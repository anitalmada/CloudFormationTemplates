## CloudFormation exercise

For exercise NÂ°4 in Edrans onboarding process I had to design multiple templates and validate them using `aws cli` or CloudFormation Console.

The full stack includes:
- VPC
- Internet Gateway
- Public and private subnets
- Custom routing tables
- An EC2 instance using outputs from the main template
- An S3 bucket using basic nested templates

_I'd like to thank @kennyk65 for [this awesome article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/aws-vpc-cloudformation/) which made my life easier XD_
